## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`

## Description

When starting, we measure the number of items that will fit on the screen (all items have the same height).

Track the scroll of the window. When scrolling down - add a new item to the end of the list and remove one item from the beginning. When scrolling up - vice versa (not currently supported).

### ToDo

- Support scrolling up
- Show browser native scroll
